# Story Of Water The Plant Pomodoro
# When you enable dark-mode, you can see shooting stars and it actually gives a clue that we are somewhere in space. 
# Water the Plant is normally used to mean donate and help even if it is only a little. We used this expression to motivate us to continue working and being consistent. 
# As we study, we make the plant grow. Than, we make collections by collecting plants. 
# In the future, we will use the trees inour collection to green the arid lands, and we will give life and save the planets with these lands. This is the part of the story that brings our imagination to life and motivates us. 
# Currently, as users, we are growing plants using different timer modes and aim to grow our collection.
